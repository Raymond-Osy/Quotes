 ## Instructions
 To get started with the web app, on a text editor, open `app.js` and start building out the app's functionality.
Also open the `styles.css` to add styles and colors to the web app and finally the `index.html` for laying out the html building blocks. You could use my Repo as a guide to building yours :)
